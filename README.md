# Countries
Free IPTV with legally receivable TV channels for Kodi, VLC or other media players as .m3u for Kodi. :-) The idea and the launch of the repo started at the end of 2019. From the beginning, it was written on the flag to provide ONLY LEGAL streams for everyone. You don't need a VPN, everything in the m3u's should be available everywhere.

**We now have more than 5000 free and legal streams, no rights are violated, there are no violations of existing laws. This should be supported and not boycotted with stupid hate speech (Geonsey, Apsattv, Iangh and Drspy).**

With such a large number of streams and so many contributors, mistakes can happen. The entries are always checked to the best of our knowledge and belief. Should we ever make a mistake, please report it to us as an "ISSUE".

# Simple Rules

1. ALL M3U´s ARE INTENDED FOR PRIVATE USE ONLY
2. IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO SEND US ILLGEGAL STREAMS VIA PULL REQUEST OR POST HERE IN OUR REPO
3. USE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES IS NOT PERMITTED (You can ask for it per ISSUE)
4. USE FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJEKTS ONLY WITH OUR CONSENT (You can ask for it per ISSUE)
5. DISTRIBUTING OR POSTING OUR LISTS IN GITHUB, FORUMS, HOMEPAGES OR IN SOCIAL NETWORKS IS NOT ALLOWED WITHOUT ASK US FOR THIS AND THEN ONLY WITH REFERENCE (BACKLINK TO OUR REPO)
6. INCITEMENT ON THE INTERNET RE: OUR OLD REPO AND OUR NEW REPO WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
7. STUPID FORKING IS NOT TOLERATED. IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A FORK IN ORDER TO WORK WITH US, PLEASE CLARIFY IT WITH US BEFOREHAND VIA ISSUE!

THOSE WHO THINK THEY DON'T HAVE TO OBEY THESE RULES WILL THEN READ SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR STUPID BEHAVIOUR ON GITHUB (OUR BLACKLIST(coming soon)), FACEBOOK, TWITTER, INSTAGRAM AND OUR WP-BLOCK. ;-) Special greetings here to IPTV-ORG, IPTVMATE, MAGGY (vuplus-support.org) and some insignificant, but whose website with DCMA (blocked by Google) we know! 

# How to use the m3u´s

The lists work fine with me in the IPTV Simple Client from Kodi or the VLC Player. To automatically create the individual lists
to one list, I use the Add-on IPTV-Merge from Matt Huisman. ;-) You find this great Add-on here: [IPTV Merge Kodi Add-on](https://www.matthuisman.nz/2019/02/iptv-merge-kodi-add-on.html)

Without Kodi you can use the lists in the VLC Media Player. :-)

You can also use the `ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u`, there you have all TV stations in one list (.m3u).

The remote path to the m3u´s is (Example):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Free-IPTV/Countries/master/DE01_GERMANY.m3u

or the playlist (all streams in one file):

# Important to contributors (fork)

If you add streams to your current fork and make a pull request, please note the following:

1. Pay attention to the alphabetical order (0-9. A-Z).
2. Add the same Group-Name, it is the Country
3. Do not add any GEO-Blocked streams, the streams in my M3Us can be seen by anyone, anywhere.
4. Don't add illegal streams. Unfortunately there have been people who already did that and gave the name Kodi a bad reputation through their ignorance.
5. Don't add new parameters. Only use these tags and order: #EXTINF:-1 tvg-name="" tvg-id="" tvg-logo="" group-title=""` and no others!
6. If you found the stream-address in m3u´s from another free projects, then the source must be included in the pull-request!

I'm always grateful for any help, it's a lot of work. If everything fits, your pull request will also be accepted. :-)

Have fun with our m3u´s :-)
